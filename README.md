# Keeping-Designers-Happy
Code examples from a talk [Keeping Designers Happy Via Enums](https://realm.io/news/slug-patrick-reynolds-keeping-designers-happy-enums/) given at Realm.

Checkout the various branches (step-1, step-2, and master) to follow the progressive refactor that was taken during the presentation.

Keep in mind this is demo code with the intention to be as easy and clear to present during live demo :)

Let me know your thoughts or alternative approaches!
